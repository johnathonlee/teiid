# ==========================================
# Current Configuration Bootstrap Properties
# ==========================================
#
# The following properties cause the tool current configuration to be read from
# a file. The file name is specified as a system property on each tool's command line
# as each tool has a slightly different configuration (due to logging).
#
# THIS FILE SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED.

#
# The following lines set up the CurrentConfiguration to read a file (this file, actually)
# that contains configuration properties and logging information.  The 'readerFile' property
# specifies a file to read as a resource (i.e., the location must be in the classpath)
