The sample files in this directory define how a user can define connector bindings for a VDB in Teiid using the 
JBoss connection factory mechanism. However note that in the case JDBC sources, these connection factories depend on the 
availability of the data sources that they represent. To define such data sources please look at the samples 
"<jboss-install>/docs/examples/jca" folder.
