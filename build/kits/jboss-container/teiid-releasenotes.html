<H2><A NAME="Highlights"></A>Highlights</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><B>SQL Support</B>
	    <UL>
	       <LI><B>Non-Recursive Common Table Expressions</B> - The WITH clause (and associated pushdown) for non-recursive queries is now supported.
	       <LI><B>Explicit Table Syntax</B> - TABLE x can now be used as a shortcut for SELECT * FROM x
	    </UL>
	<LI><B>JSON Support</B> - JSON, which could be obtained through the ws-translator using http calls or other methods, can be converted to XML using the system function jsonToXml.  XMLTABLE and other integration logic can then be used on the JSON results.
    <LI><B>Transaction Statements</B> - JDBC/ODBC now accepts START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK statements to control local transactions.
	<LI><B>Procedure Result Caching</B> - virtual procedure definitions may use a cache hint to cache results in the result set cache.
	<LI><B>Improved Plan Caching</B> - plans used by internal materialization and stored procedure plans will be automatically cached in the prepared plan cache.  Improvements were also made to reduce the memory footprint of the plans.
    <LI><B>Refined Load Balancing and Fail Over</B> - clients can use use the statement "SET NEWINSTANCE TRUE" to allow their connection to select a new server instance.  See the Client Developer's Guide for more information. 
    <LI><B>Simplified Role Usage</B> - a role can now be assigned to any authenticated user via the any-authenticated attribute on the data-role element.
    <LI><B>Materialized View Performance</B> - materialized view tables will now automatically create and use non-unique secondary indexes for unique constraints and indexes defined on the view. 
    <LI><B>Binary Web Service Calls</B> - the ws translator now provides an invokeHttp procedure to return the blob contents and string content type of an http/https call.
    <LI><B>Improved clustering support</B> - see the Admin Guide chapter on clustering.
    <LI><B>IPv6 support</B> - Teiid can started using IPv6 bind address and can be used with JDBC connection.
    <LI><B>SESSION_ID</B> - A new system function "SESSION_ID" is added to the system function library.
    <LI><B>Assignment Syntax Improvements<B> - Teiid's procedure syntax for assignments was clarified so that the assignment value must be a proper expression.  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE update counts must be obtained from VARIABLES.ROWCOUNT, scalar values must be obtained via a scalar subquery. The parser will continue to accept the old syntax and convert the query into the proper form.
    <LI><B>TEXTAGG</B> - SQL support for Text aggregation. Using this function expression values can be aggregated into a CSV BLOB with configurable delimiter, header, and encoding.  The result can be optionally saved to a text file.   
</UL>

<h2><a name="Compatibility">Compatibility Issues</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for named parameter syntax using param=value has been deprecated, since it is ambiguous with a comparison predicate boolean value expression.  param<b>=></b>value should be used instead.  
</ul>
<h4>from 7.1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Subqueries are no longer allowed to be SELECT INTO.
  <li>INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE cannot be used to create implicit return cursors in non-update virtual procedures.  You can instead use "UPDATE ...; SELECT VARIABLES.ROWCOUNT;".  
  <li>The SYSADMIN schema was created to hold procedures and tables that should not be generally accessible.  SYS and pg_catalog are now always accessible - permissions do not apply to these schemas.  The SYS.getBinaryVDBResource, SYS.getCharacterVDBResource, and SYS.getVDBResourcePaths have been replaced with the
 SYSADMIN.VDBResources table.  The Matviews table and the refreshMatView/refreshMatViewRow procedures were also moved into SYSADMIN.
  <li>Overwriting an existing VDB will cause old connections to be terminated.  Production systems should rely on VDB versioning.
  <li>The jdbc:metamatrix JDBC URL prefix is no longer accepted.  Use jdbc:teiid instead.
  <li>Model visibility no longer restricts access to tables and procedures.  Setting visible to false will only hide entries from system tables.  Data roles should be used to restrict data access.
  <li>Admin API "getWorkManagerStats" methods renamed to "getWorkerPoolStats". Also, "setRuntimeProperty" and "getProcesses" methods were removed.
  <li>By default the "ENV" system function is now turned off. To enable it, edit the teiid-jboss-beans.xml configuration file.
  <li>The use of VARIABLES.ROWCOUNT is now reserved.
  <li>Exec statements of the form "var = EXEC foo()" are only valid if the procedure foo has a return parameter.
</ul>
<h4>from 7.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The term data policy was replaced with data role.  The AdminAPI methods for adding role mappings have changed from addRoleToDataPolicy and removeRoleFromDataPolicy to addDataRoleMapping and removeDataRoleMapping respectively.
</ul>
<h4>from 6.2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The connector API has changed substantially.  Custom connectors need to be retargeted to the new Translator API.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1003">TEIID-1003</a> and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_developers_guide.pdf">Developer's Guide</a> for more information.
  <li>Connector bindings are no longer valid.  Use the Designer Tooling or see the AdminShell download for a migration utility.
  <li>Calling out to web services and xml processing has been dramatically simplified and improved, but is a breaking change from prior releases.
  XML/Relational processing has been replaced by XMLTABLE, retrieving XML from file has been replaced by the File Translator/Resource Adapter, and
  web service calls have been replaced by the WS Translator/Resource Adapter.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1118">TEIID-1118</a>, <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1114">TEIID-1114</a>, and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_reference.pdf">Reference</a> guide for more information.
  <li>The direct usage of XQuery has been replaced with the XMLQuery function.
  <li>The text connector file processing has been replaced with the TEXTTABLE function.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1102">TEIID-1102</a> and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_reference.pdf">Reference</a> guide for more information
  <li>Double quoted values are now parsed as identifiers by default.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-145">TEIID-145</a> and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_reference.pdf">Reference</a> guide for more information.
  <li>The system information schema has changed from System to SYS.  The tables and table structures have also changed.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-871">TEIID-871</a> and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_reference.pdf">Reference</a> guide for more information.
  <li>Client control over query plans has changed.  OPTION PLANONLY, DEBUG, and SHOWPLAN are no longer allowed.  This behavior should not be controlled by the SET statement, SET SHOWPLAN (ON|OFF|DEBUG) and SET NOEXEC (ON|OFF).  Usage of the client PlanNode class will also need to be updated.   
  <li>Teiid specific JDBC client interfaces and methods have changed.  In general these custom features have mostly been moved to other more standard locations or been removed. See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1020">TEIID-1020</a> and the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_client_developers_guide.pdf">Client Developers</a> guide for more information.  
  <li>Teiid's reserved words have changed.  Many of the Teiid specific reserved words have become non-reserved words.  All of SQL Foundation and SQL/MED 2003, and SQL/XML from SQL 2006 reserved words have been added as reserved words.  It is generally required to double quote all reserved words.  It is advisable to double quote all non-reserved words as well.  The use of the INPUT qualifier for procedure inputs has been deprecated in favor of INPUTS.  The use of the USING qualifier for dynamic SQL inputs has been deprecated in favor of DVARS.
  <li>The AdminApi has been redesigned for use with the new Translator/JCA split and for deployment in JBoss AS.
  <li>The AdminShell is based on Groovy.  Most BeanShell syntax is also valid in Groovy, but there are extensive changes in the AdminAPI that may necessitate rewriting scripts.
  <li>OPTION NO CACHE &lt;table list&gt; will now only by-pass cache for the given tables at their immediate view layer.  Previously all caches would have transitively been skipped.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-900">TEIID-900</a> for more information.
  <li>Nan and +-Infinity are no longer allowed as numerical results by default.  This may be changed via the system property org.teiid.allowNanInfinity.
  <li>The scale of BigDecimal values is now adjusted to allow for more intuitive results.  Conversion from floating numeric types will preserve the approximate scale and division results will allow for additional scale.  See <a href="https://jira.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-159">TEIID-159</a> for more information.
  <li>The 7.0 client is not compatible with 6.x or vice versa.  It is expected that 7.0 clients will be compatible with 7.x releases for standard JDBC operations.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Configuration">Configuration Issues</a></h2>

See the <a href="teiid-docs/teiid_admin_guide.pdf">Admin Guide</a> for more on configuration and installation.

<h4>from 7.1</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Teiid clients now allow the usage of anonymous SSL by default.  
    This changes allows the admin port (default 31443) to use anonymous SSL by default, rather than just securing login traffic.  
    Admin clients should therefore use the mms protocol instead of mm.  This will encrypt all admin traffic and ensure that any passwords in configuration files will
    be encrypted in transit.  See the Admin Guide to upgrade from anonymous SSL to 1-way or 2-way authentication.
    The config properties sslEnabled and clientEncryptionEnabled for SSLConfiguration beans have been combined to a single property mode, that can have the values disabled|login|enabled.
	<li>Apache CXF is now expected to be used as the web services stack provider through JBossWS-CXF.  See the Admin Guide for instructions on 
	installing CXF for use with Teiid's Salesforce and web service connectors.  The WS Resource Adapter's -ds.xml files should no longer use 
	WSSecurityConfigURL and WSSecurityConfigName, rather they should be ConfigFile and ConfigName respectively.  The property values should no longer
	refer to jboss-wsse-client.xml, but instead they should reference a CXF Spring configuration file and particular port configuration.  See the Admin Guide
	for more on using CXF configuration files. 
	<li>The default for data role checking is now "true".  However only VDBs with data roles will have roles enforced.
	<li>The default prepared plan cache size was increased to 512, since it is targeted by internal plans as well.
</ul>

<h4>from 7.0</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The property to enable data roles in teiid-jboss-beans.xml has changed from useEntitlements to useDataRoles.
	<li>Rar file names no longer contain version numbers.  -ds.xml files should be updated from connector-XXX-version.rar to teiid-connector-XXX.rar
	<li>Code table relate configuration properties have been removed.  Code tables are now implemented as materialized views.
</ul>

<h4>from 6.2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A JBoss AS instance is now required.  Embedded mode is also currently not supported.</li>
  <li>Engine configuration is now handled through the admin console or deploy/teiid/teiid-jboss-beans.xml 
  <li>Logging is now done through the container's log4j instance.  Any Teiid specific logging changes, see the conf/jboss-teiid-log4j.xml, need to be incorporated into the master jboss-log4j.xml.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Other">Other Issues</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>For compatibility with the 7.0 release if a stored procedure parameter list begins with identifier=, then it will be parsed as a named parameter invocation even if the intent was to use a comparison predicate 
	as the first parameter value.  The workaround is to use nesting parens, e.g. call proc((identifier=value), ...), which clarifies that this is positional value.  This workaround will not be needed in later releases.  
</ul>
<h4>from 7.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed xsd type handling for SQL/XML and XML document models.  xsd:date, xsd:dateTime, and xsd:time types will now all be displayed using the GMT timezone (Z).  SQL types, such as timestamp, used for an XMLTABLE column will now expect their values to be in the form of the corresponding xsd type.
</ul>
<h4>From 6.2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Start time is now significantly longer due to the container deployment.  However many operations can be performed on configruation files that will trigger a redeployment without the need for a restart.
  <li>Inversion of parse, format, and convert system functions is not used if it can be narrowing.  In situations where a predicate has the form: parseTime(column, 'format') = {t 'time value'} may lead to reduced performance, since
      the parseTime function cannot be pushed down.  This should be addressed in future releases.   
</ul>

<h2><a name="LibraryUpdates">Thirdparty Library Updates</a></h2>

The following components have been updated:
<h4>From 7.1</h4>
<ul>
    <li>json-simple 1.1 was added.
