		The Teiid system provides a wealth of information using logging. To control logging level, 
        contexts, and log locations, you should be familiar with log4j and the container's 
        <filename>jboss-log4j.xml</filename> configuration file.  Teiid also provides a 
        <filename><replaceable>PROFILE</replaceable>/conf/jboss-teiid-log4j.xml</filename> containing 
        much of information from this chapter.  Refer to the Administrator Guide for more details about 
        different Teiid contexts available.  Refer to <ulink url="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/"/> 
        for more information about log4j.
		</para>
		
        <para>
			If the default log4j logging mechanisms are not sufficient for your
			logging needs you may need a different appender, refer to the log4j javadocs at
			<ulink url="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/index.html"/>.   
            Note that log4j already provides quite a few appenders including JMS, RDBMS, and SMTP.
		</para>
		<para>If you want a custom appender, follow the Log4J directions to write a custom appender. Refer to 
		the instructions at <ulink url="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html"/>. If you develop a custom 
            logging solution, the implementation jar should be placed in the "lib" directory of the JBoss AS server profile
			Teiid is installed in.

            <title>Command Logging API</title>
            <para>
                If you want to build a custom appender for command logging that will have access to 
                log4j "LoggingEvents" to the "COMMAND_LOG" context, the appender will receive a message that is an instance of
                <code>org.teiid.logging.CommandLogMessage</code>.  The relevant Teiid classes are defined in the <code>teiid-api-&versionNumber;.jar</code>. 
                The CommmdLogMessage includes information about vdb, session, command sql, etc.  CommandLogMessages are logged at the DEBUG level.  If the COMMAND_LOG is at the TRACE level,
                then CommandLogMessages will also contain the query plan for user queries after the NEW event.  A typical event sequence is user query NEW, optional user query PLAN, some number of source query NEW/END, then the user query END.
                CANCEL and ERROR events are also captured.
