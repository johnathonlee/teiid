	<para>The AdminShell methods (named contextual connections, AdminAPI
		wrapper, and help system) have no direct dependencies on Groovy and be
		used in other scripting languages.</para>
	<para>To use the AdminShell methods in another language, simply import
		the static methods and Admin classes into your script. You will also
		need to ensure that the &lt;admin shell
		dist&gt;/lib/teiid-{version}-client.jar and &lt;admin shell
		dist&gt;/lib/teiid-adminshell-{version}.jar are in your class path. The
		snippet below show import statements
		that would work in Java,
		BeanShell, Groovy, etc.</para>

import static org.teiid.adminshell.AdminShell.*;
import org.teiid.adminapi.*;

	<para>Note that the provided shell and console executables
		automatically have the proper class path set and inject the proper
		imports into running scripts. If you wish to use scripts in a
		non-Teiid Groovy environment, you will need to manually add these
		imports and add the admin/client jars to the class path.
