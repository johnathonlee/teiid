	<title>System Properties</title>
	<para>Some of Teiid's low-level behavior can be configured via system properties, rather than through configuration files.  
	A typical place to set system properties for JBoss AS launches is in the &lt;jboss-install&gt;/bin/run.conf.  A property setting
	has the format -Dproperty=value</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>org.teiid.allowNanInfinity</emphasis> - defaults to false.  Set to true to allow numeric functions
			 to return NaN (Not A Number) and +-Infinity.  Note that these values are not covered by the SQL specification.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>org.teiid.useValueCache</emphasis> - defaults to true.  Set to false to disable the value cache. 
			Value caching is used dynamically when buffer memory is running low to reuse identical values, but at a computational cost.  
			If there is memory available, you should first increase the buffer memory rather than disabling value caching.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>org.teiid.ansiQuotedIdentifiers</emphasis> - defaults to true.  
			Set to false to emulate Teiid 6.x and prior behavior of treating double quoted values without leading identifier parts as string literals, which is not
			expected by the SQL specification.
