   <title>Introduction to Admin Tools</title>
   <para>
     AdminShell provides scripting based programming environments that enable user to access, monitor and control a Teiid
     Server. The Shell and Console tools are built on ones provide by the Groovy (
     <ulink url="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">http://groovy.codehaus.org/</ulink>
     ) project.  The AdminShell tools be used in ad-hoc scripting or to run pre-defined scripts.

   	 <title>AdminShell features:</title>
     <listitem>
       <para>fully functional programming environment with resource flow control and exception
         management. See <ulink url="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</ulink> docs for the full power of the language.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
       <para>quick administrative tool. The user can connect to a running Teiid Server and invoke any of
         the Admin API methods, such as "deployVDB" or "stopConnectionFactory", to control Teiid System. 
         Since this can be script driven, these tasks can be automated and re-run at a later time.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
       <para>simplified data access tool. The user can connect to a VDB, issue any SQL commands, and view the
         results of the query via <ulink url="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Database+features">Groovy Sql</ulink> extensions.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
       <para>migration tool. This can be used to develop scripts like moving the Virtual Databases
         (VDB), Connection Factories, and Configuration from one development environment to another. This will
         enable users to test and automate their migration scripts before production deployments.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
       <para>testing tool. The JUnit (
         <ulink url="http://junit.org/">http://junit.org</ulink>
         ) test framework is built in, see <ulink url="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Unit+Testing">Groovy Unit Tests</ulink>. User can write regression tests for checking system health, or data
         integrity that can be used to validate a system functionality automatically instead of manual
         verification by QA personnel.

     <title>Where can you find AdminShell?</title>
     <para>AdminShell is distributed along with other Teiid downloads under "teiid-{version}-adminshell-dist.zip" name. Download and unzip this
       file to any directory. Once you have unzipped the file, in root directory
       you will find "adminshell" and "adminconsole" executable scripts.</para>
     <para>Windows: Double click or execute "adminshell.cmd"</para>
     <para>*nix: Execute the "adminshell.sh" script</para>
