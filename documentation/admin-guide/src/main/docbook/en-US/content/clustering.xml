   <title>Clustering in Teiid</title>
   <para>Since Teiid is installed in JBoss AS, there is no separate configuration needed on the part of the user to cluster the Teiid instances.
   To cluster JBoss AS instances use these <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/docs/5-x.html">instructions</ulink> then Teiid instances
   are clustered as well. Just make sure that you installed Teiid in every JBoss AS node before starting the cluster. 
   There is one specific configuration that needs to be done for enabling the replicated (distributed) cache in Teiid. 
   To enable distributed cache rename "&lt;jboss-as&gt;/server/&lt;profile&gt;/deploy/teiid/teiid-cache-manager-jboss-beans-rename-me.xml" file
   to  "&lt;jboss-as&gt;/server/&lt;profile&gt;/deploy/teiid/teiid-cache-manager-jboss-beans.xml".

        Typically users create clusters to improve the performance of the system through

   <para>If would like a clustered deployment of the VDB and data-source artifacts, i.e. deploy artifacts to a central 
   location and let the system propagate deployments every where, then look into 
   <ulink url="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossFarmDeployment">JBoss Farm Deployment</ulink>. Note that this only supports hot deployments. 
   Take look at some commonly asked questions <ulink url="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JoinTheClusterBeforeUpdatingTheFarmDirectory">here</ulink>. 
   If you need more fine grained control, you can use script based deployment, where you control the deployment of artifacts into each node, or
   JBoss AS "deploy" folder can be configured as a <emphasis>shared</emphasis> folder among all the clustered JBoss AS nodes to achieve farming.</para>
