		<para>The MetaMatrix System, when used in its totality, enables your end user applications to process queries that select (and even update) data from one or more of your enterprise information sources, regardless of the native physical data storage method used by each enterprise information system.  This means that a single query can access, reference, and return results from multiple integrated data sources.</para>

		<para>Within the MetaMatrix System, the MetaMatrix products (including the MetaMatrix Designer, the MetaMatrix Server, and the MetaMatrix Repository), enable you to create and manage metadata models: representations describing the nature and content of your enterprise information systems.</para>

		<para>Once captured, this valuable metadata can searched, analyzed, and applied by applications throughout your enterprise.</para>
