# MetaMatrix Logging
# ==================
#
# Define the startup logging configuration and destinations.
#
# The destinations must be defined as bootstrap properties, and there
# is no mechanism to add, remove change or alter the destinations during
# runtime.
#
# Log to the window running the application ...
# metamatrix.log.console=true
# metamatrix.log.consoleFormat=com.metamatrix.common.log.format.ReadableLogMessageFormat

# Log to a file (the token "%VM_NAME% gets replaced with the name of the VM) ...
metamatrix.log.file=..\\log\\console_%VM_NAME%.log
metamatrix.log.fileAppend=false
metamatrix.log.fileFormat=com.metamatrix.common.log.format.DelimitedLogMessageFormat

# Capture system out & err to log file
metamatrix.log.captureSystemOut=true
metamatrix.log.captureSystemErr=true
metamatrix.log.systemOutFilename=../log/console.out
metamatrix.log.systemErrFilename=../log/console.err

# 
# The logging configuration parameters, however, may be
# changed during runtime.  The values must be one of the following
# integer values:
#     0  No logging
#     1  Critical logging only
#     2  Errors messages
#     3  Warning messages
#     4  Information (default)
#     5  Detail logging, useful for debugging but not horribly verbose
#     6  Trace messages, most detailed and very verbose
#
metamatrix.log=4

#
# The discarded contexts define those message contexts that are to be 
# ignored and discarded, regardless of each message's level.  If empty
# or not specified, all contexts are recorded.
#
#metamatrix.log.contexts=

# Optional log manager parameters that control the worker
# thread pool.
#
#metamatrix.log.minThreads=1
#metamatrix.log.maxThreads=1
#metamatrix.log.threadTTL=600000
#metamatrix.log.threadWaitTimeout=60000
#metamatrix.log.threadAddThreshold=20

#
# The full path and file name of the User Preferences file for this application
