This is a howto of the following:

1.	Creating unit tests that use 1 or more datasources
2.	Setting up a datasource to be used during testing
3.	Executing the db integration tests


==========================================
Creating Unit Tests
==========================================

-	Unit test should be created under db/src/test/java 
-	See SingleSourceTransactionTest.java as an example 

	NOTE:  the current tests are currently  organized by the number of datasources they require in order
			to give some organization to the test for tracking purposes.
			
-	Test should extend org.teiid.transaction.test.BaseAbstractTransactionTestCase


-	NOTE:  the following is used in a post test phase of validating the data in the datasource 
-	when calling: this.getSource("modelname")			--- the "modelname" represents the model for which
													you want the connection for
													
			INFO: to know which source this model is mapped to, find the config properties file being
					loaded for this test (default is the default-config.properties) and look for
					the model-to-datasource mapping(s)
					
					The default Transaction.vdb has 2 models:  pm1 and pm2


==========================================
Setting up a Datasource to be used during Testing
==========================================

-	see the readme.txt in src/main/resources/datasources regarding defining a datasource
-	run the maven profile to execute the process to create the required tables:
		a.  to setup all sources at one time, run:   mvn install -P setupdatasources 
		b.	to setup a specific source, run: mvn install -P singledatasource -Ddatasource=derby
		

==========================================
Executing the db integration tests
==========================================

The default profile in the pom.xml is set to compile and run the test.   So running:  mvn clean install
will compile and run the test.  
It does not run and setup a datasource.   See above "Setting up a Datasource to be used during Testing".
